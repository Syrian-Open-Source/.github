# Contributing to our repositories
We would love for you to contribute to our repositories and help make it even better than it is today!
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:
- [Suggest a new idea](#Suggest-a-new-idea) 

## Suggest a new idea
We aim to spread the work of Syrian developers to the outside world within the vision of spreading open source concepts in the Middle East and Syria,
so we receive many important ideas and software for publishing and that deserve to publish so there are a number of developers want to contribute to them and to learn from them
Therefore, we have specified an email in which we will receive all the thoughts that are on your mind.
All of these ideas will remain confidential if you don't work on them.
We confirm not to develop or publish anything as long as it is not stated by the owner of the idea.

** How to send this email **
To help us organize getting ideas, we created an email template.
It is preferable that you send an email from the same structure as this template.

 - Body:
   - brief of your work
   - used technologies
