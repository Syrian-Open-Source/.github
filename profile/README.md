# Syrian Open Source Platform

## What is syrian open source ?
we are not just a platform on GitHub, we are a culture
that we want to spread in regions that are not
interested in participating in open source software.

The Syrian Open Source platform is the first platform on
GitHub dedicated to bringing Syrian developers from
different cultures and experiences together, to work on
projects in different languages, tasks, and versions, and
works to attract Syrian developers to contribute more
under one platform to open source software, work on it,
and issue it with high quality and advanced engineering
features, which It stimulates the dissemination of the
open-source concept in the Syrian software community,
and also contributes to raising the efficiency of developers
by working on distributed systems and teams.

All technologies and programming languages such as node js, laravel, python ..etc
